this is some stuff

Once when I was a wee lad I had a grape from an orange tree..

'twas such a fine orange it was (I thought it was a grape)

Once when I was a little bigger I ate some bark off of a dawg

The dawg looked like a tree and I was hugreeeeeee

When the dog greew up I was still a young man

strange that the dog had a thing for eating bark off of trees

but what he thought were trees were cats
