Once when I was a wee lad I had a grape from an orange tree..

'twas such a fine orange it was (I thought it was a grape)

I ate that orange in my toy car

my toy car turned out to be a boat

I always wondered why it didn't have wheels

I pushed that car around for years

Once when I was a little bigger I ate some bark off of a dawg

The dawg looked like a tree and I was hugreeeeeee

When the dog greew up I was still a young man

strange that the dog had a thing for eating bark off of trees

but what he thought were trees were cats

these cats were not really cats though.. that was my bad

what I always thought were cats were apparantly trees

that dawg was smarter than me

I wasn't sure so I took him to the vet

the vet said that they only treat amnimals

that vet said my dawg was a cat!
